Privacy policy
==============

Babble requires the audio recording permission to function.
The audio recording is initiated only when the user presses the large yellow microphone button,
which stays red for the duration of the recording.
The recording does not take place under any other conditions nor at any other time.

Babble obtains the transcription of the spoken user input from a third party speech recognizer
which can be selected from the menu "Settings" -> "Speech recognizer".
Only services that exist as apps on the device and that conform to the standard Android speech recognition interface
are available for selection.
Depending on the used service, the audio data might be streamed over the internet along with other user data.
Please consult the privacy policy of the app that you have chosen to provide the recognition service.

Apart from using a third party speech recognizer, Babble does not store, collect nor share any user data.
