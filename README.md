Babble
======

Babble is an Android app that shows you short phrases/sentences in many different languages and you'll have to
pronounce them quickly (in 4 seconds) and correctly. Babble will give you feedback in the form of
an edit distance between the transcription of your pronunciation and the original phrase.

Components of a typical practice session:

  - tap on the big yellow button and read out loud the displayed text (in the correct language)
  - tap on the text to try again
  - tap on "Phrases" to see the history of phrases, sortable by various parameters
  - tap on a phrase to listen to its correct pronunciation
  - tap on "Plot" to see the graph of your error levels in different languages

Babble uses the services of speech-to-text and text-to-speech that are available via standard Android APIs.
The apps that provide these services (e.g. Google Voice Search for speech-to-text,
various TTS engines for text-to-speech) have to be installed separately in case they are not
already pre-installed.

The current version is a prototype.
The core of it was developed in October 2012 by 3 Android enthusiasts over a weekend in the beautiful library of Genk,
Belgium, as part of the V Hack Android hackathon.
